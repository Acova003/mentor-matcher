## System Overview

Mentor Matcher harnesses ChatGPT's AI capabilities to streamline CodeOp School's mentorship program. By using AI to pair mentees with mentors, we reduce administrative costs and promote meaningful connections.

## System Components

### Frontend

Built with ReactJS, the frontend provides a responsive and intuitive interface, facilitating user interactions, data collection, and displaying mentor-mentee matches.

### Backend

The backend, powered by Node JS, oversees server-side operations, processes requests, and integrates ChatGPT data for optimal mentor-mentee matching.

### Database

MySQL is utilized as the database, storing both mentor and mentee questionnaire responses and the resultant ChatGPT matching data.

### External API Usage

#### Open AI API

We integrate ChatGPT from OpenAI to refine the mentor-mentee matching process. The AI analyzes responses from both participants to suggest the best matches. Learn more from the [OpenAI official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt).

## System Architecture

Mentor Matcher adopts a client-server architecture. The frontend communicates with the backend to handle data in the database, with ChatGPT central to the matching procedure.

- **Presentation Layer**: Developed using ReactJS, it guarantees a top-tier user experience. Additionally, there's an administrative authentication mechanism ensuring secure access.
- **Application Layer**: Backend services in Node.js process user requests and handle database communication, while strict validation methods ensure data consistency.
- **Data Layer**: MySQL efficiently handles data storage, with a well-structured database schema representing all relevant entities.
